1) When you are shooting something, you simply CANT send anything.
! I need to create a bool method to figure out would shooting now will be more useful:
    Factors:
    * How much info that exact satellite already has
    *! How much info can I send in the closest visibilityWindow
    *! How much info can I send in the next visibilityWindow

2) I cant send anything, so I should think about how to maximize it

3)
    Result should look like this

    For each sending:
    Satellite - Station - PointOfInterest - TimeWindow - TimeInterval - Value;

    Somewhere in the end:
